        <p>As a long-time Washington State resident and small business owner, I am excited to expand into a new horizon.  My professional experiences cover a variety of industries, including; transportation, medical care, office administration, real estate, automotve repair, addictions counseling, ranching, animal care, and volunteer work with domestic violence survivors.  I am proud to say that I have two lovely daughters, five grandchildren and one great-grandchild.  My husband and I have been married since 1986 and are both military Veterans.  We have traveled, as professional drivers, 48 out of 50 States.  Once, we touched 46 States in as little as 2 1/2 months; and I love this beautiful country,  My interests include:  computers, since 1980; photography; music: singing and playing guitar, piano, trumpet, and violin; competitive shooting: pistol, shotgun, and rifle: boating and canoeing, and my fur babies (two beautiful Staffordshire Terriers).  </p>
